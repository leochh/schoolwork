Question 1:   
     |---------------------+--------------------------|
     | Minimum Support (%) | No. of Frequent Itemsets |
     |                  20 |                       20 |
     |                  10 |                       68 |
     |                   5 |                      268 |
     |                   3 |                      659 |
     |---------------------+--------------------------|
   
Question 2:
     |---------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------|
     | Minimum Support (%) | No. of Frequent Itemsets | No. of Frequent 3-Itemsets | No. of Frequent 2-Itemsets |
     |                   3 |                      659 |                        424 |                        190 |
     |---------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------|
   
     Percentage of frequent 3-itemset = 424 / 659 = 64.34%
     Percentage of frequent 2-itemset = 190 / 659 = 28.83%

Question 3:
     |---------------------+------------------------+--------------------------|
     | Minimum Support (%) | Minimum Confidence (%) | No. of Association Rules |
     |                   5 |                     50 |                      117 |
     |                  10 |                     50 |                        0 |
     |---------------------+------------------------+--------------------------|

     The smaller the minimum support is, the more the number of strong rules generate.

Question 4:
     Rule1: Ice Cream, Olive, Tea --> Banana
     Rule2: Banana, Ham, Salad --> Apple
     Rule3: Ham, Diaper, Coffee --> Ice Cream

Question 5:
     Interesting Rules:
     Coffee, Salad, Lemon --> Egg, Apple   (Minsup=2%, Minconf=100%, Lift = 10.588)
     Nuts, Coffee, Salad --> Apple, Ketchup     (Minsup=2%, Minconf=100%, Lift = 9)
     
     These are the two most interesting rules I found when minsup is 2% and
     minconf is 100%. The measure used to identify the interestingness of the
     rule is Lift, which shows the correlaton between two itemsets. The higher
     the value of Lift is, the more positively correlated these two rules are.
