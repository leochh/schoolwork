* Algorithm Description
** 1. Bisection method
      The bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding method that
      repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a
      subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing.
** 2. Newton-Raphson method
      The Newton-Raphson method is a method for finding successively better
      approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.
      The formula of Newton-Raphson method:
      x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n)/f^'(x_n)
